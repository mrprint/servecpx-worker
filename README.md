GameCPx Worker
==============

This worker is a part of a GameCPx control panel which is primary written for game hosting.
This project was started in 2013 year as pet project, and abandoned in 2015, not released. *This version of worker may be broken, i dont remember ;D*

Worker written in python 2.6, and contain many portions of shit-code, so if you want, you can help me to fix it through pull requests, and feel free to make any changes of shid code.

How to start
============

You must configure the worker. Just copy `docs/worker-config.template` to `config/devel.py` and fill required options, then just run `listen_tasks.sh` script
